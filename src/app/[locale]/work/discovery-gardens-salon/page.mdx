## Overview

The design concept is inspired by creating a calm, feminine, and luxurious retreat where clients feel relaxed, pampered, and confident. Soft arches, warm neutral tones, and natural textures are used to create a welcoming and intimate atmosphere. Blush and deep rose accents are balanced with warm wood flooring and subtle gold details, adding a sense of elegance without overwhelming the space. Feature wall murals introduce a natural, organic touch, enhancing the feeling of serenity and escape.
