## CRITICAL FINDINGS

> [!CAUTION]
> **The "AI tell" words we removed were actually the CLIENT'S OWN WORDS from the PDF.**
>
> The PDF uses: "cutting-edge technology", "forward-thinking solutions", "seamless operation", "seamless project execution". These are NOT AI-generated — they are the client's chosen brand language. Our earlier edits changed their voice.

> [!WARNING]
> **Email discrepancy**: PDF says `info@designedbyemerald.ae`. User said `.com`. Need final confirmation — the PDF is the source document.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **No slogan/tagline exists in the PDF.** Cover page shows only "DESIGNED BY EMERALD" — no tagline.

> [!WARNING]
> **Yas West Villa description differs** between PDF and current MDX file. The PDF text is NOT what's currently on the website.
